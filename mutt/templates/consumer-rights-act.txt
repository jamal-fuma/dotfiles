Dear Clive,

Thank you for your email of 28th December 2015.

I write further to our conversion and wish to clarify the position.

As requested, I am writing to request a response which can be provided to the Consumer Ombudsman to explain your position.


We had a conversation on 28 December 2016 at 17:12pm where you explained
that "Tower London" held itself to not be subject to the "Consumer Right Act 2015" (CRA 2015) with
respect to the faulty goods purchased from your store at "6 The
Broadway, High Road, Wood Green, London, N22 6DS" with receipt number
"TOWE097912"


I further explained that as such "Tower London" is obligated to provide a replacement or refund in respect of the faulty goods, under the provisions of section 20) "Right to
+Reject" of (CRA 2015).


I would like to reiterate my position and request that you comply with the relevant legislation.

The (CRA2015) makes it an implied term of the contract
I have with Tower London that goods be as described, fit for purpose
and of satisfactory quality.

As you are in breach of contract and I've owned the product for less
than 30 days I am within my statutory rights to ask for it to be
replaced at no further cost to me.

I await confirmation that you will provide the remedy set out above
within 14 days of the date of this letter.


Yours Faithfully,
