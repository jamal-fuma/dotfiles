This is my github in general https://github.com/jamal-fuma

The specific build system project was originally here https://github.com/jamal-fuma/autoscaffold
Over time, it birthed https://github.com/jamal-fuma/fuma_build_scripts
and https://github.com/jamal-fuma/fuma_build_aux and https://github.com/jamal-fuma/fuma_m4

This is used in projects like
https://github.com/jamal-fuma/rapidxml-wrapper as git-submodules
