Hi Ben,

So attached are two documents,

The first [1] is the short version, see (attached) BERR: AGENCY WORKERS: KNOW YOUR RIGHTS 2008, p6 [1] 'If you are an incorporated work-seeker (i.e. you have your own company or work through a limited company),
you are automatically covered by the regulations but you can choose to give notice to your agency to opt-out before being introduced to a hirer.
Agencies cannot make the provisions of their work-finding services conditional on an incorporated work-seeker opting out.'

The second [2] is the longer version see (attached) GUIDANCE ON THE CONDUCT OF EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES AND EMPLOYMENT BUSINESSES REGULATIONS 2003,
p34" [2] 'Regulation 32(13) provides that an employment agency or employment business may not make the provision of its work-finding services conditional
upon either a limited company or the worker to be supplied giving notice to opt out of the Regulations.'

The third this the legisislation itself [3] as can be seen here see http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/3319/regulation/32/made, is see (attached) THE CONDUCT OF EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES AND EMPLOYMENT BUSINESSES REGULATIONS 2003, p2, (32)(13)
'Neither an agency nor an employment business may make the provision of work-finding services to a work-seeker which is a company conditional upon the work-seeker, and the person who is or would be supplied by the work-seeker to carry out the work, entering into and giving notice of an agreement as referred to in paragraph (9), to the agency or employment business.


[1] and [2] and offical publications and [3] is the government reference, I hope this helps clarify my position and request that you comply with the relevant legislation.
